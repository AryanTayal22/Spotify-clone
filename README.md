# Spotify Clone using HTML and CSS only

This project is a static clone of Spotify’s web UI designed to closely mimic the original music streaming platform's look and feel. It includes key interface elements such as the sidebar navigation, top bar, album/song cards, and a bottom playback bar. Using semantic HTML5 and advanced CSS styling (including Flexbox and Grid), the layout is fully responsive and visually accurate. The design follows Spotify’s signature dark theme, creating an engaging user interface that demonstrates attention to detail and strong front-end layout skills.
